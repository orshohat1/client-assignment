# Project Structure
* store.ts - defines createStore() which creates a redux store. uses reducer.ts to import the reducer
* reducer.ts - defines all things related to the state and its reducer
* index.tsx - creates a store using createStore() and passes it to react-redux's component. this connects the whole React app to the redux store
* actions.ts - defines all the action creators that we'd like to use for dispatching actions in React components. we use mapDispatchToProps and wrap these action creators with a dispatch function
* App.tsx - this is the main component which you add all your components into
